#DESCRIPTION 

This command can be invoked as `redux init` or, through a symlink, as `redo-init`.

The init command creates and initializes a .redo directory,
which holds the redo configuration and database files
and also demarcates the root of a redo enabled project.

The redo-init command must be invoked before any other redo commands can be used
in the project directory or sub-directories.

The command is idempotent and can be safely invoked multiple times in the same directory.
