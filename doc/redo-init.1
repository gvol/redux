.SH NOTES
.PP
If one or more DIRECTORY arguments are specified, the command
initializes each one.
If no arguments are provided, but an environment variable named REDO_DIR
exists, it is initialized.
If neither arguments nor an environment variable is provided, the
current directory is initialized.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command can be invoked as \f[C]redux\ init\f[] or, through a
symlink, as \f[C]redo\-init\f[].
.PP
The init command creates and initializes a .redo directory, which holds
the redo configuration and database files and also demarcates the root
of the redo enabled project.
.PP
The redo\-init command must be invoked before any other redo commands
can be used in the project.
.PP
The command is idempotent and can be safely invoked multiple times in
the same directory.
