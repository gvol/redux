# NAME

init - Creates or reinitializes one or more redo root directories.

# SYNOPSIS

redux init [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY ...]

# OPTIONS

  -?	Show help

  -h	Show help

  -help

    	Show help


# NOTES


If one or more DIRECTORY arguments are specified, the command initializes each one.
If no arguments are provided, but an environment variable named REDO_DIR exists, it is initialized.
If neither arguments nor an environment variable is provided, the current directory is initialized.


#DESCRIPTION 

This command can be invoked as `redux init` or, through a symlink, as `redo-init`.

The init command creates and initializes a .redo directory,
which holds the redo configuration and database files
and also demarcates the root of the redo enabled project.

The redo-init command must be invoked before any other redo commands can be used
in the project.

The command is idempotent and can be safely invoked multiple times in the same directory.

#EXAMPLES        

redo-init DIRECTORY
  ~  The target directory is specified as an argument.

env REDO_DIR=DIRECTORY redo-init
  ~ The target directory is provided by the REDO_DIR environment value.

redo-init
  ~ The target directory not provided at all, so the current directory is used.
