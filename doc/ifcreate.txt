# DESCRIPTION

This command can be invoked as `redux ifcreate` or, through a symlink, as `redo-ifcreate`.

The `ifcreate` command marks the current target as out of date when a
non-existent prerequisite file comes into existence or is deleted.

This command should be placed in a do file and not run directly.
