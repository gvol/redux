TODO List

- Todo items begin with a dash
  * Starred items are done.

-* A starred Todo item is completely done.

-* bug -- detect and break loops in dependency chain.

- Add redo-stamp for compatibility with other implementations.

- Add command to list database entries. Either for a single file or all files.

-  Add mechanism to run jobs in parallel
    Useful for 'redo' or 'ifchange' with multiple targets.

- Expand documentation on ifcreate:
  'redo-ifcreate a` creates a dependency on the nonexistent file `a`.
  If `a` exists redo-ifcreate complains and exits with an error status.

- optimization -- rewrite redoTarget with sets:

  old = existing prerequisite keys
  new = new prerequisites keys

  deletes = old - new
  writes = new - old
  # updates
  for each file in old && new
      if !file.IsCurrent() {
          add file to deletes
          add file to writes

  delete(deletes)
  put(writes)

  In most cases, this will eliminate a number of redundant operations.


- Increased verbosity should
  *  Show do file selected
     Show file stats for generated output


- Tests
      Add docker based test with external suites
    * check arguments
    * writing to stdout vs file
    * cross project dependencies

- Use different database?

  Doubtlessly, an embedded SQL or key value database would be faster.
  Need to ensure serializable access.

-*  Add debug flag

-* Change verbosity > 2 behaviour to use debug

-* Combine into single executable with commands.

    redux init
    redux ifchange
    redux ifcreate
    redux redo

    With links to redux for each command.

-* Rebuild binary for tests

-* Add support for multiple levels of extensions.

- Consider slightly different file storage
  every object gets a SHA1

        prerequisite (source SHA, dest SHA, data, type {static, auto, standard})
        dependency (source SHA, dest SHA)
        metadata (source SHA, data)

- Add requirements.txt file for hacking on redux

- Add config file. redux init can create a default config

- Add apenwarr configuration value and make it fully compatible with apenwarr redo when enabled.
    $2 arg depends on do script. Basically, the missing prefixes, if any, from the do script are
    appended to the $2 arg.

- Generate PDF docs
